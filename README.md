This repo contains the R markdown and compiled HTML file describing my analysis of predicting the type of fitness exercise based on movement data from various meters that were held during the exercise. The analysis is part of the Course Project for the Coursera class on Practical Machine Learning, provided by Johns Hopkins University.
